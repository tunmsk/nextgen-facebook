<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/nextgen-facebook/assets/icon-256x256.png">

<p><strong>NGFB uses <em>existing</em> content to generate meta tags + Schema markup</strong> &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional settings or values, <em>but if you want to</em>, you can customize just about anything and everything. ;-)</p>

<p><strong>NGFB creates <em>complete</em> and <em>accurate</em> meta tags + Schema markup</strong> &mdash; including hashtags, video seo, e-commerce products, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, ratings, event details, recipe information, and much more &mdash; all from your <em>existing</em> content.</p>

<p><strong>NGFB provides special optimization features for Pinterest</strong> &mdash; offering customized Pinterest image sizes and preventing conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook / Open Graph meta tag values.</p>

<p><strong>NGFB includes advanced <em>quality control</em> features and options</strong> &mdash; checking minimum / maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios, verifying the webpage for duplicate meta tags, showing notices for missing and required images, along with theme header template validation.</p>

<p><strong>NGFB can enhance and integrate with your favorite SEO plugin!</strong> &mdash; NGFB specializes in providing all the meta tags + Schema markup social sites and search engines need, and you can still continue to use your favorite SEO content / keyword analysis tools!</p>

<p><strong>Don't need the included social share buttons?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO)</a> plugin is a fork / child of NextGEN Facebook (NGFB) &mdash; they have the same author, the same solid core features and code-base, but WPSSO is distributed without the social share buttons and their related features. Additional Free extension plugins are also available for WPSSO, including two different types of sharing button extensions:</p>

NGFB can also include hashtags from WordPress and NextGEN Gallery tag names in the Facebook / Open Graph / Pinterest Rich Pin descriptions, Tweet text, and other social captions.

= Complete Social Meta Tags =

NextGEN Facebook (NGFB) adds Facebook / Open Graph, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and all social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, hashtags, images, videos, e-commerce product details, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). NGFB uses *existing* content to generate meta tags + Schema markup &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional settings or values.

**Images and Videos**

NextGEN Facebook (NGFB) detects and uses all images - associated or included in your content - including the WordPress image gallery and [NextGEN Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) shortcodes. WordPress Media Library images (and NextGEN Gallery in the Pro version) are resized according to their intended consumer (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc). The Pro version detects embedded videos from Facebook, Slideshare, Vimeo, Wistia, and Youtube (including preview image, video title, and video description). NGFB (Pro version) also includes support for [NextGEN Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries and images (shortcodes, image tags, album / gallery preview images, etc.).
