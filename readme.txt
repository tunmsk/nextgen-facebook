== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/nextgen-facebook/assets/icon-256x256.png">

<p><strong>NextGEN Facebook uses your <em>existing</em> content to create meta tags + Schema markup</strong> &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional settings or values, <em>but if you want to</em>, you can customize just about anything and everything. ;-)</p>

<p><strong>NextGEN Facebook creates <em>complete</em> and <em>accurate</em> meta tags + Schema markup</strong> &mdash; including hashtags, video seo, e-commerce products, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, ratings, event details, recipe information, and much more &mdash; all from your <em>existing</em> content.</p>

<p><strong>NextGEN Facebook offers special optimization features for Pinterest</strong> &mdash; providing an image for the Pin It button, excluding non-relevant images, and preventing conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook meta tag values.</p>

<p><strong>NextGEN Facebook includes advanced <em>quality control</em> features and options</strong> &mdash; checking minimum / maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios, verifying the webpage for duplicate meta tags, showing notices for missing and required images, along with theme header template validation.</p>

<p><strong>NextGEN Facebook can enhance and integrate with your favorite SEO plugin!</strong> &mdash; NextGEN Facebook specializes in providing all the meta tags + Schema markup social sites and search engines need, and you can still continue to use your favorite SEO content / keyword analysis tools!</p>

<p><strong>Don't need the included social share buttons?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO</a> plugin is a fork / child of NextGEN Facebook &mdash; they have the same author, the same solid core features and code-base, but WPSSO is distributed without the social share buttons and their related features. Additional Free extension plugins are also available for WPSSO, including two different types of sharing button extensions:</p>

= Social Sharing Buttons =

NextGEN Facebook comes with several social share buttons, that you can optionally include on post / page editing pages, above / below your content or excerpt, [bbPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single pages, [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activity entries, CSS sidebar, widget, shortcode, and even call a function from your theme template(s).

A default language can be chosen in the NextGEN Facebook settings, and the [Pro version](https://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) switches the social share button language with the webpage language / WordPress locale. NextGEN Facebook can also include hashtags from WordPress and NextGEN Gallery tag names in the Facebook / Open Graph / Pinterest Rich Pin descriptions, Tweet text, and other social captions.

= Complete Social Meta Tags =

NextGEN Facebook adds Facebook / Open Graph, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and all social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, hashtags, images, videos, e-commerce product details, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). NextGEN Facebook uses *existing* content to generate meta tags + Schema markup &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional settings or values.

= 3rd Party Integration (Pro version) =

**Images and Videos**

NextGEN Facebook detects and uses all images - associated or included in your content - including the WordPress image gallery and [NextGEN Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) shortcodes. WordPress Media Library images (and NextGEN Gallery in the Pro version) are resized according to their intended consumer (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc). The Pro version detects embedded videos from Facebook, Slideshare, Vimeo, Wistia, and YouTube (including preview image, video title, and video description). NextGEN Facebook (Pro version) also includes support for [NextGEN Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries and images (shortcodes, image tags, album / gallery preview images, etc.).

<blockquote class="top_info">
<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">release early, release often (RERO) software development philosophy</a> on Wikipedia for more information on the benefits of smaller / more frequent releases.</p>
